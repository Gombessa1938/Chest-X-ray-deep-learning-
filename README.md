# Chest-X-ray-deep-learning-

This is a project for chest xray scan identification. The orignal data is imbalanced, despite using image augmentation, drop outs to pervent overfitting, the performance of my DNN net is still not perfect. I believe this is probably due to imbalanced dataset and maybe incorrected labeling, since I personally can not check if the data is labeld correctly or not.
